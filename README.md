# GitMind
GitMind is a visual Windows Git client, which intends to make it easier to use Git, especially when using a branch model similar to e.g. GitFlow. GitMind visualizes the branch structure more like one imagines the branches, instead of just showing branches exactly as the Git raw data. 

## Background
Most current Git clients tends to visualize the branches in the same way as an overwhelming number of branches, which makes the commits history difficult to understand. As a workaround, many developer simplify history by rebasing or squashing.

Some clients like e.g. Visual Studio tries to reduce the complexity. But I think that the legacy Bazaar QLog interface might provide a better inspiration.

The GitMind client provides an user experience, where the visualization of branches and commits history is understandable and usable without the need for rebasing or squashing. GitMind also simplifies usage of the most used commands.
