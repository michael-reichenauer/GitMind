GitMind is a Windows GUI Git client, which makes it easier to use Git, especially when using a branch model similar to e.g. GitFlow. GitMind visualizes the branch structure more like one imagines the branches, instead of just showing branches exactly as the Git raw data specifies. GitMind makes it easy to toggle which branches to show and hide, and simplifies using the most common git commands.

## Background
Usually Git clients tend to visualize the branches in the same way as an overwhelming number of branches, which makes the commits history difficult to understand. As a workaround, many developers simplify history by rebasing or squashing.

Some clients tries to reduce the branch complexity by simply hiding commits. A better approach is to make it possible to toggle which branches to show and which branches to hide. Thus a user can focus on tracking branches that really matter.

GitMind provides an user experience, where the visualization of branches and commits history is understandable and usable without the need for rebasing or squashing. GitMind also simplifies usage of the most common commands by providing context menus and simplified dialogs.
